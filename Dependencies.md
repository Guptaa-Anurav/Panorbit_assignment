# List of Dependencies/Requirements to Run the Code

Before running the code for the "Simple Landing Page" and "User Profile Page" projects, you need to ensure that certain dependencies and requirements are met. These dependencies include software and extensions that are necessary for the proper execution of the code. Below is the list of dependencies and requirements:

## 1. Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
- VS Code is the code editor used for writing, editing, and managing the code for the projects.

- Website: [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## 2. Live Server Extension for VS Code
- The Live Server extension allows you to quickly launch a local development server and view your web pages with real-time updates as you modify your code.

- Installation: Open VS Code, click on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar, search for "Live Server" in the Extensions Marketplace, and click the "Install" button.

## 3. Web Browser
- A modern web browser is required to view and interact with the web pages locally.

- Recommended browsers: Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, or Safari.

## 4. Internet Connection (Optional)
- An internet connection is not strictly required to run the code locally. However, if you want to access external resources (e.g., images, APIs) used in the code, an internet connection will be necessary.

## 5. Google Maps API Key (Optional)
- The "User Profile Page" project uses the Google Maps API to display the user's location on a map. If you want to see the map functionality, you will need to obtain a Google Maps API key.

- Website: [https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key)

## 6. Image Resources (Optional)
- The code uses image resources for user profile pictures. If you want to replace the placeholder images, you can use your own image URLs or store the images locally.

## 7. Access to "https://panorbit.in" (Optional)
- The "Simple Landing Page" project fetches user data from the "https://panorbit.in" API to populate the user table. If you have restricted internet access or the API is unavailable, you may not see the data in the user table.

## Conclusion
To run the code for the "Simple Landing Page" and "User Profile Page" projects, ensure that you have installed Visual Studio Code with the Live Server extension. Also, make sure you have a modern web browser to view the pages. If you want to access external resources or view the map functionality on the user profile page, an internet connection and a Google Maps API key will be needed. With these dependencies and requirements in place, you can run and explore the projects on your local development environment. Happy coding!
